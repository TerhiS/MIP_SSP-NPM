# MIP_SSP-NPM

Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MIP) models for the job sequencing and tool switching problem with non-identical parallel machines.

Three different MIP models are presented in [GAMS_models](https://github.com/TerhiS/MIP_SSP-NPM/tree/master/GAMS_models). 
1) precedence-based
2) position-based
3) time-index-based

## Abstract
*This paper addresses the generalisation of the NP-hard job sequencing and tool switching problem with non-identical parallel machines and sequence-dependent setup times where a set of jobs is to be scheduled on a set of unrelated parallel machines with machine-dependent processing and tool switching times. Three different mathematical models are presented for two different objectives and are applied to a set of newly generated test instances, publicly available. The instances are compared and analysed using a standard commercial solver and a simple iterated local search heuristic. Overall, it is shown that the solution quality obtained by the mathematical models depends on the size of the problem instance as well as the tool requirements. Computational results show that, based on the given computation time limit, the precedence-based formulation in general is superior to the position-based and time-index-based formulation for dense problem instances while the position-based formulation works well for sparse problems. With an increasing problem size, however, the ILS metaheuristic requires significantly less time to find near-optimal solutions than the mathematical models.
