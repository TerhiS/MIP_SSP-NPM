# MIP_SSP-NPM
Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MIP) models for the job sequencing and tool switching problem with non-identical parallel machines (SSP-NPM).
## Abstract
*This work addresses the generalisation of the NP-hard job sequencing and tool switching problem with non-identical parallel machines 
and sequence-dependent setup times where a set of jobs is to be scheduled on a set of unrelated parallel machines with machine-dependent processing and tool switching times. 
Three different mathematical models are presented for two different objectives and are applied to a set of newly generated test instances, publicly available. 
The instances are compared and analysed using the IBM CPLEX solver and a simple iterated local search heuristic.*

## MIP Models
# Content
Three different MIP models are provided in [GAMS_models](https://github.com/TerhiS/MIP_SSP-NPM/tree/master/GAMS_models). 
1) [precedence-based](https://github.com/TerhiS/MIP_SSP-NPM/tree/master/GAMS_models/precedence-based.gms)
2) [position-based](https://github.com/TerhiS/MIP_SSP-NPM/tree/master/GAMS_models/position-based.gms)
3) [time-index-based](https://github.com/TerhiS/MIP_SSP-NPM/tree/master/GAMS_models/time-index-based.gmx)

## Iterated Local Search
An Iterated Local Search (ILS) heuristic is provided in [ILS](https://github.com/TerhiS/MIP_SSP-NPM/tree/master/ILS).
The ILS consists of the [construction heurstic](https://github.com/TerhiS/MIP_SSP-NPM/blob/master/ILS/constr_heur.R) to build the initial solution the [local search] to obtain the local optimum 
and the [perturbation](https://github.com/TerhiS/MIP_SSP-NPM/blob/master/ILS/ils.R) in order to overcome local optima. The specific [README](https://github.com/TerhiS/MIP_SSP-NPM/blob/master/ILS/README_ILS.md) in the ILS folder contains detailed information about the ILS heuristic.
