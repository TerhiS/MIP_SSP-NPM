# MIP_SSP-NPM

Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MIP) models for the job sequencing and tool switching problem with non-identical parallel machines.

Three different MIP models are presented in [GAMS_models](https://github.com/TerhiS/MIP_SSP-NPM/tree/master/GAMS_models). 
1) precedence-based
2) position-based
3) time-index-based

Experiments were conducted on a 3.20 GHz Intel Core i8-8700 processor with 32 GB of memory running under Windows 10. 
IBM CPLEX 12.8 on GAMS 25.1.3 was used to implement and solve the mathematical model while allowing CPLEX to use all cores in parallel.
