# MIP_SSP-NPM
Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MIP) models for the job sequencing and tool switching problem with non-identical parallel machines (SSP-NPM).
## Abstract
*This work addresses the generalisation of the NP-hard job sequencing and tool switching problem with non-identical parallel machines 
and sequence-dependent setup times where a set of jobs is to be scheduled on a set of unrelated parallel machines with machine-dependent processing and tool switching times. 
Three different mathematical models are presented for two different objectives and are applied to a set of newly generated test instances, publicly available. 
The instances are compared and analysed using the IBM CPLEX solver and a simple iterated local search heuristic.*
