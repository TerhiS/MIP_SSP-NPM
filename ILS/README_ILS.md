The ILS consists of the [construction heurstic](https://github.com/TerhiS/MIP_SSP-NPM/blob/master/ILS/constr_heur.R) to build the initial solution the [local search] to obtain the local optimum 
and the [perturbation](https://github.com/TerhiS/MIP_SSP-NPM/blob/master/ILS/ils.R) in order to overcome local optima.
